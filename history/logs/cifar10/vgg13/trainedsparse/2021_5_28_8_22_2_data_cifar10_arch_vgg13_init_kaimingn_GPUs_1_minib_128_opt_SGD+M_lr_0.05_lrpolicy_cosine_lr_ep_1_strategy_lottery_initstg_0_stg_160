=> Global rank of the current node is 0 and the process id is 10561.
=> There are 1 process(es) runing on GPU(s).
=> Visible GPU(s) are ['4'] for running 1 process(es).
=> Execute `nvidia-smi` on a differnt terminal to see used GPUs.
=> GPU 4 whose id is 0 is being used for training of the current process.

Files already downloaded and verified
=> The model, i.e., vgg13, is being replicated on 1 processes.
